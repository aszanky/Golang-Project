Do you implement the clean architecture in your application? if yes, please explain
How to scale up your application and when it needs to be

Answer :
I have implemented a clean architecture method, trying to follow Uncle Bob’s techniques, 
I have split code based on the purpose. 
The entity is the important thing for business, 
Repository is for Data Store using gcache memory cache, 
Delivery is for delivering use-case (gRPC, rest, messaging queue and more) here I am using gRPC, 
lastly is the use-case for the business logic. 
The clean architecture method has to pay attention to business logic separation.

Scale-up the application, 
I think it relates to scalability. 
When our app can’t able to handle more users, transactions, requests, 
at that time we have to decide to scale up our application. 
I think for now if we are using a cloud, we can use autoscale features.
